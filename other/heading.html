    <h2>What is Java Constructor?</h2>
    <p>
        A Constructor in Java is a <strong>special method</strong> that is used to intialize objects.It contains <strong>collection of statements(i.e. instructions) </strong>that are excecuted at a time of object creation. Every class has a constructor which is called when an object is created in class.</p>
        <p>If we do not <strong>explcitly write a constructor</strong> for class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class. Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor. Constructors have only one purpose i.e. <strong>Creating an object for the class and initializing the instance variables.</strong></p>
